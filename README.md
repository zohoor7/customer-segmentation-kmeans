# customer-segmentation-kmeans
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to group similar data points into k clusters based on feature similarity. In this project, weâ€™ll apply K-Means to simulate customer data (e.g., annual income and spending score) to identify customer segments like "high spenders" or "budget-conscious" shoppers.
