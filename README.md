# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.  
By identifying clusters like "High Spenders" or "Budget-Conscious Shoppers", businesses can better target their marketing strategies.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

Segment customers into distinct groups based on:
- Annual income (in $1000s)
- Spending behavior

This allows businesses to:
- Understand customer behavior
- Offer personalized promotions
- Enhance marketing efficiency

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- `NumPy` for numerical operations
- `Matplotlib` for data visualization
- `Scikit-learn` for applying the KMeans algorithm

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is simulated with 20 customers, each represented by two features:
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**

Example data:
```python
[15, 39], [16, 81], [17, 6], [18, 77], [19, 40], ...

## 🧮 K-Means Clustering

We used `k=3` clusters to group customers into 3 segments.  
The algorithm automatically detects patterns and assigns each customer to one of the clusters.

## 📈 Visualization

The following chart shows:
- Each customer as a colored point
- Cluster centers as red ❌ markers

##🧠 Output Example

Cluster Centers (Annual Income, Spending Score):
Cluster 1: Income = 21.43, Spending Score = 60.43
Cluster 2: Income = 87.50, Spending Score = 75.00
Cluster 3: Income = 83.33, Spending Score = 25.00
