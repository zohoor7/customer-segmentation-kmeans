# ðŸ§  Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.  
By identifying clusters like "High Spenders" or "Budget-Conscious Shoppers", businesses can better target their marketing strategies.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

Segment customers into distinct groups based on:
- Annual income (in $1000s)
- Spending behavior

This allows businesses to:
- Understand customer behavior
- Offer personalized promotions
- Enhance marketing efficiency

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- **Python**
- `NumPy` for numerical operations
- `Matplotlib` for data visualization
- `Scikit-learn` for applying the KMeans algorithm

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset is simulated with 20 customers, each represented by two features:
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**

Example data:
```python
[15, 39], [16, 81], [17, 6], [18, 77], [19, 40], ...
